OOSQL
-------

This is a Perl 6 Role, which allows you to build classes which represent
tables in an SQL database. It provides several methods that abstract out
the SQL syntax, so instead of doing:

  my $result = $db.sql("SELECT name,job FROM mytable WHERE id = $id;");
  if ($result) {
    my @rows = $result.rows();
  }

You can do:

  my @rows = $mytable.where(:$id).select(:name,:job);

NOTE: This is completely unfinished and still in early development stage.
      Don't try to use this, it doesn't actually work yet.
