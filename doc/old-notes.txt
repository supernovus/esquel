OOSQL Notes
-----------------

Taken from when this was WW::Model::Table. I've pulled out the obsolete
stuff, and made a new document outlining a future project that will use
Esquel::DBI to implement two Roles making a full Database ORM possible.

Modifiers such as where(), limit(), order-by(), group-by() and having()
MUST come BEFORE select(), update(), and delete() statements.
In fact, update() and delete() will refuse to run by unless a where() 
modifier has been set (use where(*) if you really want to update or delete 
everything.)

Modifiers that don't apply to the statement will be ignored (so for
insert statements, ALL modifiers will be ignored.)

More examples:

  $employees.group-by('department').having(:MAX(:salary(:lt(50000))))
    .select('department',:MAX(:salary(:as('highest')));
  
  Becomes:

  SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS 'highest'
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING MAX(salary) < 50000;

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: 

Convert Seq into Hash via:

  for %!fields.kv -> $key, $value is rw {
    if $value ~~ Seq { %!fields{$key} = %($value) }
  }
